# Movie-Recommender-System 
A movie recommendation system using 2 methods- content based and collaborative filtering.
I have used the movies dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ .
For content based recommendations, recommendations are given based on most similar genres and most similar feedback given by various users about the movie.
Collaborative filtering gives recommendations based on similar ratings given by users for different movies.
